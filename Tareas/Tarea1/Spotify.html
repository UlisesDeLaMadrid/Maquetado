        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Please read these Terms of Use ("<strong>Terms</strong>") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music <br> and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "<strong>Spotify Service</strong>") and any <br> music, videos, podcasts, audiobooks, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service ("<strong>Content</strong>").
        </p>
        <h3>2. The Spotify Service</h3>
        <h5>Spotify Service options</h5>
        <p>
            We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free of charge, while other options require payment before they <br> can be accessed ("<strong>Paid Subscriptions</strong>"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products <br> and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Your Use of the Spotify Service</h3>
        <h5>Creating a Spotify account</h5>
        <p>
            You may need to create a Spotify account to use all or part of the Spotify Service. Your username and password are for your personal use only and should be <br> kept confidential. You understand that you are responsible for all use (including any unauthorized use) of your username and password. Notify our Customer <br> Service team immediately if your username or password is lost or stolen, or if you believe there has been unauthorized access to your account.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Content and Intellectual Property Right</h3>
        <h4>User Content</h4>
        <h5>The content you post on the Spotify Service</h5>
        <p>
            Spotify users may post, upload, or otherwise contribute content to the Spotify Service ("<strong>User Content</strong>"). For the avoidance of doubt, User Content includes all <br> information, materials and other content that is added, created, uploaded, submitted, distributed, or posted to the Spotify Service (including to the Spotify <br> Support Community) by users.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Customer Support, Information, Questions, and Complaints</h3>
        <h5>Spotify support community</h5>
        <p>
            Spotify Community is a place for discussions and exchange of information, tips, and other materials related to the Spotify Service. By using Spotify Community, <br> you agree to the Community Terms.
        </p>
        <h5>Customer support, information, questions, and complaints</h5>
        <p>
            For customer support with account- and payment-related questions ("<strong>ustomer Support Queries</strong>"), please use Customer Support resources listed on the <br> About Us section of our website.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Problems and Disputes</h3>
        <h5>Suspending and terminating the Spotify Service</h5>
        <p>
            These Terms will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Spotify. Spotify may terminate these Terms (including any additional terms and <br> conditions incorporated herein) or suspend your access to the Spotify Service at any time if we believe you have breached any of these Terms, if we stop <br> providing the Spotify Service or any material component thereof, or as we believe necessary to comply with applicable law. If you or Spotify terminate these <br> Terms, or if Spotify suspends your access to the Spotify Service, you agree that Spotify shall have no liability or responsibility to you, and (except as expressly <br> provided in these Terms) Spotify will not refund any amounts that you have already paid. You may terminate these Terms at any time, in which case you may not <br> continue accessing or using the Spotify Service. To learn how to terminate your Spotify account, please use the Customer Support resources on our About Us <br> page.
        </p>
        <h3>7. About These Terms</h3>
        <p>
            Under applicable law, you may have certain rights that can't be limited by a contract. These Terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
        </p>
        <h5>Changes</h5>
        <p>
            We may make changes to these Terms (including any additional Spotify terms and conditions incorporated by reference herein) from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the revised Terms on the applicable Spotify Service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-service pop-up message, or other prominent notice within the Spotify Service, or other means). Your use of the Spotify Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. Premium Subscribers who do not wish to continue using the Spotify Service under the updated Terms must close their Spotify account prior to their renewal date or thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, whichever occurs first. If Spotify makes any material change to the Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes via email to tounotice@spotify.com. This opt-out notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of when we notify users of the change and include: (1) your name, address, email address associated with your Spotify account, phone number, and Spotify username. Such an opt-out must be sent by you personally from your personal email address, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. The opt-out notice also must include a statement that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. Even if you opt out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement, you and Spotify agree that any Dispute will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement in effect immediately before any such opt-out.
